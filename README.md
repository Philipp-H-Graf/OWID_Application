# OWID_Application

This Github-Reposity provides all codes and data used in my sample of work. The underlying data-set was not uploaded as the file exceeds Github's threshold of 100 MB.

## Austria.rda

This is the dataframe used to show how the information is stored one step before producing the final data-frame. By means of Austria, I visualize the storage of the data.

## Master.R

This R-file shows the code from the start (reading the data) all the way to the end (final dataframe used to visualize the results) of the process. To read the verbal explanation of how the code works, please refer to the RMarkdown-files **OWID.Rmrd** and **OWID.html**.

## Master_Thesis_GRAF.pdf

My master's thesis.

## OWID.Rmd

The R-Markdown-File create for the Sample_of_Work.html

## OWID_FILE.rda

This is the final dataframe used for the two final plots in the RMarkdown.
